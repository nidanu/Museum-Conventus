    <div class="textbox">
        <p> Museum Conventus provides easy access to museum collections and facilitates locating items across the globe.</p>
        <p> Inspired by JSTOR, Museum Conventus was created as part of a university programming module. </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;"> Good to know: </p>
        <p> 
            The V&A and MET APIs are capped at 100 results per request. Museum Conventus makes use of open access APIs, which may result
            in slow data collection rates. 
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;"> How are my search results obtained? </p>
        <p> 
            Museum Conventus uses the user's search term in the API requests. Each museum returns the results that are deemed relevant
            according to their search criteria. They are ordered by title and artist.
